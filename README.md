# Residual Networks Based Distortion Classification and Ranking for Image Quality Assessment
This is the code for multi-label classification problem of distortion classification and distortion ranking. The code has been built and tested with a laparoscopic image dataset related to Laparoscopic Video Quality (LVQ) Database. Identification of distortions and predicting 
the severity level of distortions are both important to apply corresponding enhancement technique  for correction. This step is vital especially in critical applications like laparoscopic surgery.
